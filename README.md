# Thinkful Data Analytics - Capstone II: Business Research Project

This capstone project required students to complete a business research project. Two datasets were provided; one about home pricing and the other about vehicle fuel economy. I opted to process the fuel economy dataset. This project challenged students in data exploration, testing hypotheses, and presenting their research findings.

After processing the data, my hypotheses went over vehicle class affecting highway MPG and vehicle class affecting annual fuel costs. The excel document includes the raw data provided by the course as well as my data processing and summary for the data. The PowerPoint presentation is the slide deck used to present the material to a member of the Thinkful community for grading and approval.
